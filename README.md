# Default-Risk
This project predicts the risk of defaulting on a personal loan. The data itself is simulated, and therefore so are the results. The purpose of the project is to experiment with the concept of a risk score given by credit companies. The paper derives it's own credit score, and also determines the accuracy of the model.
